  Mainly working on backends and gamedev, my stack is C#, C++, Python, a bit of Lua, and learning Rust at the moment. I have a mindset of an engineer, so i love to learn how all technology works and love to solve any technical challenges. Love reverse-engineering too, mostly arm/Android.

Doing not only software, but a bit of hardware too. When it comes to embedded/hardware - mostly C/C++. I can solder, make basic schematics, know how to make DIY boards at home, love reading datasheets and crafting some things.
